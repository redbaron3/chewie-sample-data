Ra's Al Ghul: Gotham's time has come.

Alfred: Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.

Ra's Al Ghul: Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men. And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness.

Blake: When their enemies were at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.

Batman: It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.

Batman: It was a dog. It was a big dog.

Ra's Al Ghul: We have purged your fear. You are ready to Iead these men. You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows. But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.

Alfred: You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse... for not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.

Joker: Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

Joker: How about a magic trick? I'm gonna make this pencil disappear. Ta-da!

Bane: Citizens, take control. Take control of your city!

Ra's Al Ghul: But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangIing the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed so you'd be spared your pain.

Blake: Gordon... You do like to play things pretty close to the chest.

Bane: Ooh, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it. Molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man. By then there was nothing to be but blinded.
